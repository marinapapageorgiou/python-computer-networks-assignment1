        <h3><u>Personal Info</u></h3>
        <p id="main-text">
            My name is Aristeidis. I am from Ioannina, Greece and I am currently studying Informatics at USI as an exchange student.
            I started doing my bachelor at the <a href="https://www.cs.uoi.gr/?lang=en">University of Ioannina</a> since 2017, I am at the end
            of my studies and I wanted to do my last semester in Switzerland.

        <h3><u>My City</u></h3>
        <p id="main-text">
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannina">Ioannina</a> is the city where I was born and raised. It is located
            in the west part of Greece near Corfu, in a mountainous area, with a lake by the city. Also, there is a historical castle 
            which is worthy to pay a visit, as well as the island of Ioannina which is the only residential island in a lake, in whole Europe.

        <h3><u>Why Informatics</u></h3>

        <p id="main-text">
            I remember myself since a very young age attracted to computers. I used to play video games and spending
            hours in front of a screen. During my early education I always liked math, until I randomly discovered computer programming.
            The first moment I interacted with that, it instantly grabbed my serious attention, and I felt that this is my future.
            So, undoubtedly I applied for Computer Science after high school. There was a good university in my city, so I went there.
            University Of Ioannina.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Why Lugano</u></h3>
        <p id="main-text">
            I always wanted to experience the Erasmus students' exchange program. I wanted to apply at the end of my studies. Between the available 
            universities in the list from the bilateral agreements the USI stood out. I was going to apply at 2020 but because of the covid situation
            I thought it would be better to wait for a year. And so that happened. I applied last year. I got accepted and then I applied for to stay at 
            USIHome. And that is where I live for now. Also, I thought it was a good opprtunity to get a glimpse of Switzerland.
            Lugano is located by the Alps, which is a great opportunity to exploit to visit the beautiful places and landscapes of the 
            Alps.

        <h3><u>Hobbies</u></h3>
        <p id="main-text">
            Since my childhood, I always played sports. In my primary school I signed up for a table tennis club in my city,
            and I had been playing for 10 years. I also participated, in competitions and I had successes. I really enjoy that 
            sport. Then, I switched to martial arts. I did kung fu for over a year and then I tried some kick boxing for a few months.
            Moreover, I am a fan of music, and I have learned to play the piano a little bit by myself.
